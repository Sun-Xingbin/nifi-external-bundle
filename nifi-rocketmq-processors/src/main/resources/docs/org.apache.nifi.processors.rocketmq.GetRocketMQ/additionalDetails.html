<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
    This Processors polls <a href="https://rocketmq.apache.org/">Rocket MQ</a>
    for data. When a message is received from RocketMQ, this Processor emits a FlowFile
    where the content of the FlowFile is the value of the RocketMQ message. If the
    message has a key associated with it, an attribute named <code>rocketmq.key</code>
    will be added to the FlowFile, with the value being the UTF-8 Encoded value
    of the Message's Key.
